    "This lab notebook coincides with CaseStudy_Churn_Analysis_2016 iPython notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Open the notebook and read the \"Introduction and Motivation\" Section.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Question 1:</b> Given that customer churn is an issue across many industries, how might problem abstraction help a data scientist solve the problem at a given company? In otherwords, can one solve it in a Telecom job and be successful solving it while working for a large gym? What parts of the problem are common across domains? Which parts require domain knowledge of the industry?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Procedure of problem formulation, data understanding etc. remains the same\n",
    "- One always has to consider the type of data available, because this impacts, amongst others, model selection. Say, in a gym more demografic data on customers may be available whereas in a telecommunication large amounts of phone usage data is avaible, possibly allowing to implement more data-intensive models.\n",
    "- Goals are common accross domains\n",
    "- In terms of problem formulation and understanding churn rate drivers, domain knowledge like an understanding of the business model is neccesary\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Question 2:</b> How should one define churn in a way that can be explicitly and unambiguously measured for each of the following industries/companies: Credit Card, Amazon, a big Gym.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The probability that a given customers drops out of the provided service (cancel the credit card / gym contract, stop shopping on amazon / cancel amazon prime)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Question 3:</b> Think about three features that may be useful for predicting churn for each of the following industries: Credit Card, Amazon, a big Gym. Do these features have anything in common?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Credit Card: Age, employment, number of card transactions within a given time period, ZIP-code, number of other credit cards held\n",
    "- Amazon: Age, number and amount of transactions in a given time period, ZIP-Code, \n",
    "- Gym: BMI, number of friends in the same gym, relationship status\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Question 4:</b> Once we have a set of factors as well as a supervised learning model, how might we use this model in a predictive and also in an explanatory way? Do we need a supervised learning model for the explanatory use case?\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Read the Problem Formulation and Data Exploration (up to Descriptive Statistics) sections. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Question 5:</b>For building a churn data set, what are two different ways we can sample both churners and non-churners into a training set? What may be the advantages/disadvantages of each?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Holdout dataset and Cross-validation\n",
    "- Holdout is easy to implement, higher risk of spurious results\n",
    "- Cross-validation is more reliable, but more complicated, dataset may be too small\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Read from the Descriptive Statistics up until Predictive Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Questions:</b>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>What level of information redundency exists amongst the variables? How would you explain this?</li>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Incoming and outcoming calls: highly correlated to each other, both are positively correlated with revenues and negatively with churn => Both variables show how actively a customer uses the service => drop one\n",
    "    \n",
    "<li>Based on the mutual information between features and churn, how would explain the most important churn factors to a colleague?</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Revenue: The more active a customer, the more satisfied, the more revenue => low churn\n",
    "- Eqpdays, months: Indicators for members who only exist on paper => they have forgotten that they still have a contract because they don't use it anymore\n",
    "- Retcalls: Customers that are not satisfied with the service but still willing to try to stay with the contractor and don't just churn => I would focus on those!\n",
    "</ul>"
